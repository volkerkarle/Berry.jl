[![Build Status](https://github.com/volkerkarle/Berry.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/volkerkarle/Berry.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

Berry.jl is a Julia package that extends the capabilities of traditional topological analysis in quantum physics. It provides a comprehensive toolkit for calculating Berry curvature, topological invariants, non-equilibrium topological invariants, and non-abelian invariants, unlocking new possibilities in the study of topological phenomena in quantum systems.

## Introduction

Understanding topological properties and their influence on the behavior of quantum systems is crucial in many areas of modern physics, such as condensed matter physics and topological insulators. Traditional topological analysis has been primarily focused on equilibrium systems and abelian invariants. However, in recent years, the study of non-equilibrium dynamics and non-abelian invariants has gained significant attention, as they reveal deeper insights into the rich topological structure of quantum systems.

Berry.jl addresses these emerging research areas by providing a comprehensive package that combines traditional topological analysis with advanced features tailored for non-equilibrium phenomena and non-abelian invariants. This package bridges the gap between theory and experimental observations, empowering researchers to explore complex quantum dynamics and uncover new facets of topological physics.
