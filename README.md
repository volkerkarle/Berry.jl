Berry.jl is a new Julia package aimed at providing essential tools for the calculation of Berry curvature, topological invariants, and potentially expanding to non-equilibrium topological invariants and non-abelian invariants related to nodal lines. This package serves as a small step towards advancing the understanding of topological phenomena in quantum systems.

## Introduction

Topological properties play a crucial role in quantum physics, particularly in condensed matter physics and the study of topological insulators. The Berry curvature ($\Omega$) and topological invariants capture the geometric phase and provide insights into the underlying topological structure of quantum states. Berry.jl is an ongoing project that aims to provide a simple and accessible means to calculate these quantities.

## Key Features

Berry.jl, in its current and planned form, aims to offer the following features:

- **Berry Curvature Calculation**: The package will provide functionality to calculate the Berry curvature ($\Omega$), a key quantity characterizing the geometric phase and topological properties of quantum states.

- **Topological Invariant Evaluation**: Berry.jl will offer methods to compute topological invariants, such as Chern numbers, winding numbers, or other essential measures that provide information about the global topology of quantum systems.

- **Potential for Non-Equilibrium Topological Invariants**: The package has future plans to extend its capabilities to include non-equilibrium topological invariants, enabling the study of topological phenomena in periodically driven systems and quenching experiments.

- **Potential for Non-Abelian Invariants**: Berry.jl aims to explore the calculation of non-abelian invariants that are related to nodal lines in quantum systems, providing a deeper understanding of the connections between topology and the presence of nodal lines.

## Why Berry.jl?

Berry.jl is a modest effort to facilitate the study of topological properties in quantum systems. By offering the ability to calculate the Berry curvature and topological invariants, this package aims to provide researchers with an accessible toolset for investigating the underlying topological structure of quantum states.

Future plans to incorporate non-equilibrium topological invariants and non-abelian invariants related to nodal lines reflect the aspiration to expand the package's capabilities and explore more complex aspects of topological physics.

With Berry.jl, researchers can take a small step towards:

- Understanding the geometric phase and its implications through the calculation of the Berry curvature ($\Omega$).

- Gaining insights into the global topology of quantum systems by evaluating topological invariants such as Chern numbers or winding numbers.

As an ongoing project, Berry.jl welcomes contributions from the scientific community to collectively advance our understanding of topological phenomena in quantum systems.
